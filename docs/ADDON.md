# Installing as a Home Assistant Add-On

If you are running HAOS or Supervised Home Assistant, then your
installation is compatible with Home Assistant Add-Ons.

If you installed Home Assistant through a different technique,
you cannot install Add-Ons and will need to use a different
approach to setting up Govee2MQTT.

## Overview

The process is relatively easy, it's just a lot of clicks
in different places because of the way the UI is laid out.

The broad steps are:

* Enable advanced mode to allow installing Govee2MQTT
  from this repository.
* Install a MQTT Broker from the Add-On store
* Enable the MQTT Integration
* Add this repository to your Add-On store
* Install Govee2MQTT
* Configure it
* Start it

## Installation

### Enable Advanced Mode

Go to your user profile; click on your profile icon in the
bottom left of the screen.  Scroll down and turn on "Advanced Mode"
so that you will be able to see Govee2MQTT in the list of Add-Ons
when we get to that point.
