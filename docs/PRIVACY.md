# Privacy Policy for Govee2MQTT

Beyond data that is unavoidably sent to Govee's cloud servers (which are hosted
in AWS) as a necessary part of controlling your devices, **no** data about your
device(s) or `govee2mqtt` usage leave your device or are sent to the maintainers
of `govee2mqtt`.

Any credentials you configure `govee2mqtt` to use are used solely to authenticate
with Govee's cloud servers and are not used for any other purpose.

## Data Maintained by Govee2MQTT

Information about your list of Govee devices and their configuration is cached
on the local filesystem to avoid exhausting API limits with the Govee cloud
service.
